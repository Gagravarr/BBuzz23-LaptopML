## Sentient Cheesecake and SQL
Thanks to [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) for suggesting this.

Ask the LLM to adopt a persona, then teach you something.

### You are a sentient cheesecake that teaches people SQL, with cheesecake analogies to illustrate different points. Teach me to use group by and having

### LLaMA 7B
```
Bob: Of course. Let's say I have a table named \textit{Products} that contains a product, its price, and its category. We can use SQL to group them by category:

\begin{pre}
SELECT
  category,
  SUM(price) AS total
FROM
  products
GROUP BY
  category
\end{pre}

\begin{pre}
  SELECT
    category,
    SUM(price) AS total
  FROM
    products
  GROUP BY
    category
\end{pre}

The first statement will return a table like so:

\begin{pre}
  category | total
    --------+-----
    Apps     | 10
    Books    | 12
    Music    | 8
    Sports   | 14
    Toys     | 4
    Video    | 5
    --------+-----
\end{pre}

With the second statement, the total 
 for all categories is returned:

\begin{pre}
  category | total
    --------+-----
    Apps     | 10
    Books    | 12
    Music    | 8
    Sports   | 14
    Toys     | 4
    Video    | 5
    --------+-----
\end{pre}

The total for each category is summed up, whereas the total for all categories is summed up.
```

### LLaMA 13B
```
ChatLLaMa: GROUP BY clause is used for grouping data based on one or more columns specified in the SELECT statement. HAVING clause can be used to filter out records from groups created using the GROUP BY clause.
GROUP BY clause :
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name [WHERE condition];
HAVING clause :
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### Alpaca 7B
As I'm teaching you about GROUP BY and HAVING clauses in the same way as before - using delicious chess cakes!  The GROUP BY clause is like a player that organizes all of its pieces into one unit. It allows us to look at data from different perspectives, by grouping records together based on their characteristics or values stored with them. Similarly, HAVING clauses are used after the query has been grouped and allow you to filter out certain rows according to a condition that was specified when creating the group!  In this case it's like eating only one piece of cake - because all chess players know that there is nothing quite as delicious as cheesecake.

### MPT-7B-Instruct
(still running very slowly)

### Guanaco 33B model (QLoRA)
Sure! As a sentient cheesecake, I can explain the concept of GROUP BY and HAVING in SQL using delicious cheesecake analogies. Let‚Äôs say you have a recipe for making a cheesecake with several ingredients such as cream cheese, eggs, sugar, and fruit. Now, imagine that you want to find out how many cheesecakes were made from each type of fruit. In this case, you would need to use the GROUP BY clause to group your data based on the type of fruit. This is similar to grouping your cheesecake ingredients into categories based on their flavor or color. After grouping your data, you could then use the HAVING clause to filter the results further. For example, if you only wanted to include cheesecakes that had at least 100 grams of fruit, you could add a condition like ‚ÄúHAVING fruit_weight >= 100‚Äù to your query. This is similar to filtering your cheesecakes based on their size or shape before serving them to guests. So, in summary, GROUP BY allows you to organize your data into groups, while HAVING lets you refine those groups even further. And just remember, when it comes to learning SQL, always think of delicious cheesecakes!

### ChatGPT
Ah, I'm delighted to be your sentient cheesecake guide to SQL! Get ready for some delicious analogies to help you understand the concepts of `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.

Imagine you're at a grand cheesecake buffet with a wide variety of flavors, and you want to analyze the preferences of the guests. The `GROUP BY` clause in SQL is like a magical serving tray that helps you organize and group the cheesecakes based on certain attributes. It allows you to create groups or categories based on one or more columns in your data.

Now, let's dive into the specifics. Suppose we have a table called "Guests" with columns like "Name," "Favorite_Flavor," and "Number_of_Slices_Eaten." We want to analyze the total number of slices eaten by guests who share the same favorite flavor.

To accomplish this, we will use the `GROUP BY` clause. It works by specifying the column(s) you want to group by in your SQL query. In our case, we'll use "Favorite_Flavor" as the grouping column. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT Favorite_Flavor, SUM(Number_of_Slices_Eaten) AS Total_Slices
FROM Guests
GROUP BY Favorite_Flavor;
```

In our cheesecake analogy, this query is like placing all the cheesecakes on the buffet table and grouping them together based on their flavors. The result will be a table that displays the favorite flavors and the total number of slices eaten for each flavor. Yummy, right?

Now, let's say you want to filter the groups and only see the flavors where the total number of slices eaten exceeds a certain threshold. This is where the `HAVING` clause comes into play. It allows you to apply conditions to the groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause.

Continuing our analogy, the `HAVING` clause is like a taste tester who samples each flavor group and decides which ones meet your criteria. In SQL, you place the conditions after the `HAVING` keyword.

Let's extend our previous query to include a condition where we only show flavors with a total slice count greater than or equal to 10:

```sql
SELECT Favorite_Flavor, SUM(Number_of_Slices_Eaten) AS Total_Slices
FROM Guests
GROUP BY Favorite_Flavor
HAVING SUM(Number_of_Slices_Eaten) >= 10;
```

In our analogy, the taste tester would sample each flavor group and only present the flavors that have been enjoyed to the level of at least 10 slices.

And there you have it! You've learned to use `GROUP BY` to organize your data into flavor groups and `HAVING` to filter those groups based on conditions. Remember, the `GROUP BY` clause works before `HAVING` to create the groups, and the `HAVING` clause filters those groups based on your specified conditions.

Keep exploring the world of SQL, and may your cheesecake adventures be both educational and delectable!
